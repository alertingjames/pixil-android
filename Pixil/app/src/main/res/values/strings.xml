    <string name="q1">What is Pixil?</string>
    <string name="a1">Modern wall art that decorates your home without damaging your wall. Pixil is removable, reusable and leaves no marks on the wall.</string>
    <string name="q2">How big is the pixil?</string>
    <string name="a2">Our pixil is 20cm by 20cm and thickness is about 8mm.</string>
    <string name="q3">How much does Pixil cost?</string>
    <string name="a3">Your first 3 pixils cost ₮50,000 and then every additional pixil in your order costs ₮15,000 each. For example, 5 pixils would be ₮80,000.</string>
    <string name="q4">How many pixils can I order?</string>
    <string name="a4">You can order as many pixils as you want. But you need to order a minimum of 3 pixils per order. </string>
    <string name="q5">When will I receive my pixils?</string>
    <string name="a5">Your pixils will arrive in about 3-5 days. (Your pixils will be delivered within 2 weeks in remote provinces and soums.)</string>
    <string name="q6">How much is shipping?</string>
    <string name="a6">Shipping is free.</string>
    <string name="q7">Do you ship internationally?</string>
    <string name="a7">Currently, our pixils can only be shipped to addresses in Mongolia.</string>
    <string name="q8">Where are the pixils made?</string>
    <string name="a8">All of our pixils are made in Mongolia to the highest quality standard.</string>
    <string name="q9">How do I hang a pixil on walls?</string>
    <string name="a9">It\’s simple. Each pixil comes with adhesive pad stuck to the back. Please peel off the protective film on the pad. Then firmly press the pixil onto the wall. </string>
    <string name="q10">Will any type of wall work?</string>
    <string name="a10">Our pixils stick to the majority of the wall surfaces that are clean, dry and smooth without dirt or dust. However, we don\’t recommend you to stick them on wallpaper with an embossed pattern or bump wall.</string>
    <string name="q11">Can I remove a pixil once it\’s on the wall?</string>
    <string name="a11">Absolutely! Just pull gently towards you from the lower part of the pixil and it will come right off the wall. They are super durable, you don\’t have to worry about damaging a pixil when you remove it.</string>
    <string name="q12">Is there a minimum photo resolution recommended?</string>
    <string name="a12">It should be at least 800 by 800 pixels. Any lower resolution photos will result in blurry and grainy pixil.</string>
    <string name="q13">What happens if I accidentally spray water on the pixil?</string>
    <string name="a13">Don\’t worry. Nothing will happen to your pixil. Each pixil is digitally printed on high-quality material in a professional environment with a fade-resistant and water-resistant coating.</string>

        Here’s an overview of our terms. You can read our complete legal information below, but these are a few of the most important bits, in plain English.\n\n

        •	<b>You still own all the pictures you order from us</b>. You keep the copyright to all your images. We won’t sell them, share them, or use them for anything other than getting your pixils printed and delivered to you. \n
        •	<b>We need access to your photo gallery to show you your pictures in the Pixil app</b>. When you open our app for the first time, it’ll ask you for permission to access your photos. We need that so we can let you select, crop, edit and order your pics in our app. If you want, you can turn that permission off in your settings later, or delete the app to remove the permission. \n
        •	<b>If you want, we’ll delete all your pictures and personal information from our systems</b>. All you need to do is send us an email to <u>info@pixil.mn</u> from the email address you entered when you made your order. \n
        •	<b>You agree not to order any pictures you don’t own, or any pornography or discriminatory content</b>. There are lots of people involved in the printing process, so we can’t print any images with nudity or offensive content. We also can’t print pictures you don’t own the copyright to.\n

        •	<b>If there’s a problem with your pixils, please bring them back to us, so we’ll replace them for you</b>. If there are any issues, just send us an email to <u>info@pixil.mn</u> or a chat through the app. We’ll get it all sorted out.\n

(\"<b>Ganzai</b>\" or, \"<b>us</b>\", \"<b>our</b>\", \"<b>we</b>\") allows users to upload images and/or pictures (\"<b>Images</b>\") to a mobile application (\"<b>App</b>\") in order to print those Images on a wall board (\"<b>Pixil(s)</b>\").

Any suspension, termination, or cancellation of Services shall not affect your obligations to Ganzai under these Terms (including but not limited to ownership, indemnification, limitation of liability and payment obligation), nor will it affect any other terms herein, which by their sense and context are intended to survive such suspension, termination, or cancellation.\n\n

<b>Content and User Content</b>\n\n

        Certain types of content may be made available through the App or the Services. \"<b>Content</b>\" as used in these Terms means, collectively, all content on or made available on the App or through the Services, including any images, photos, pictures, and any modifications or derivatives of the foregoing.\n

WE DISCLAIM ALL LIABILITY, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, FOR THE ACTS OR OMISSIONS OF USERS (INCLUDING UNAUTHORIZED USERS), WHETHER SUCH ACTS OR OMISSIONS OCCUR DURING THE USE OF THE SERVICE OR OTHERWISE.\n\n

    </string>

        <b>Intellectual Property</b>\n\n

Ganzai, its affiliates or its licensors, as the case may be, owns the App and the Services, including all worldwide intellectual property rights in the App, and the trademarks, service marks, and logos contained therein registered and unregistered.

By submitting or uploading any User Content and/or Images, you grant Ganzai and its successors a worldwide, limited, non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, sublicensable and transferable license to use, copy, and print such User Content and/or Images on the Pixil(s).\n\n

<b>Copyright</b>\n\n

        The policy of Ganzai is not to infringe upon or violate the intellectual property rights or other rights of any third party, and Ganzai will refuse to use and remove any User Content in connection with the App that infringes the rights of any third party. Under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the \"<b>DMCA</b>\"), Ganzai will remove any Content (including without limitation any User Content) if properly notified of that such material infringes third party rights, and may do so at its sole discretion, without prior notice to users at any time. The policy of Ganzai is to terminate the accounts of repeat infringers in appropriate circumstances.\n

You are in the best position to judge whether User Content is in violation of intellectual property or personal rights of any third-party. You accept full responsibility for avoiding infringement of the intellectual property or personal rights of others in connection with User Content. Ganzai will remove any Content (including without limitation any User Content) if properly notified of that such material infringes third party rights, and may do so at its sole discretion, without prior notice to users at any time.\n

If you believe that something appearing on the App infringes your copyright, you may send us a notice requesting that it be removed, or access to it blocked.

        Here\’s an overview of our terms. You can read our complete legal information below, but these are a few of the most important bits, in plain English.\n\n

•	<b>You still own all the pictures you order from us.</b> You keep the copyright to all your images. We won\’t sell them, share them,
        or use them for anything other than getting your pixils printed and delivered to you. \n
•	<b>We need access to your photo gallery to show you your pictures in the Pixil app.</b>
        When you open our app for the first time, it\’ll ask you for permission to access your photos.
        We need that so we can let you select, crop, edit and order your pics in our app.
        If you want, you can turn that permission off in your settings later, or delete the app to remove the permission. \n
•	<b>If you want, we\’ll delete all your pictures and personal information from our systems.</b>
        All you need to do is send us an email to <u>info@pixil.mn</u> from the email address you entered when you made your order. \n
•	<b>You agree not to order any pictures you don’t own, or any pornography or discriminatory content.</b>
        There are lots of people involved in the printing process, so we can\’t print any images with nudity or offensive content.
        We also can\’t print pictures you don’t own the copyright to.\n

•	<b>If there’s a problem with your pixils, please bring them back to us, so we\’ll replace them for you.</b>
        If there are any issues, just send us an email to <u>info@pixil.mn</u> or a chat through the app. We\’ll get it all sorted out.\n\n

                However, the cookies we use generally fall into one of the following categories:\n\n
                • <b>Necessary</b> - These cookies are necessary in order to allow the App to work correctly.
                They enable you to access the App, move around, and access different services, features, and tools.

                • <b>Functionality</b> - These cookies remember your settings and preferences and the choices you make (such as language or regional preferences)
                in order to help us personalize your experience and offer you enhanced functionality and content.\n\n
                • <b>Performance</b> - These cookies can help us collect information to help us understand how you use our App,
                such as whether you have viewed messages or specific pages and how long you spent on each page. This helps us improve the performance of our App.\n\n
                • <b>Analytics</b> - These cookies help us learn more about which features are popular with our users and how our App can be improved.\n\n

<b>How to Adjust Your Preferences</b>\n\n

                although settings may vary from device to device.
                Adjusting your preferences as described in this section herein does not mean you will no longer receive advertisements,
                it only means the advertisement you do see will be less relevant to your interests.\n\n
